## ZigPong

Recently I started being interested in "lower-level programming languages" asI got fascinated by systems programming. One might ask: "Ok, so why not C?" and my answer would be that it has nothing to do with me being against C. In fact, I like C and would definitely want to explore it more as I progress in my programming journey. My curiosity simply led me to picking up Zig, which I find quite fascinating (also the general philosophy behind it made me lean more towards it). Also, I was always fascinated with game programming, so I thought why not give it a spin and just combine the two. So, to code this simple game of Pong I will be using raylib, which has Zig bindings and is a really cool library. 

So far the following things are implemented:
* Basic ball mechanics, i.e., bouncing off the walls
* Paddle movement

ToDo's:
* Add a simple collision system between the ball and the paddle(s)
* Add a scoreboard
* Game state management
